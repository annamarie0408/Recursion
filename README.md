# Recursion

Write	a		program	that	lets	the	user	choose	one	of	the	four	choices	(Decimal	to	
Binary,	Decimal	to	Hex,	etc)	and	get	their	string	input.			Display	the	output	and	then	
allow	the	user	to	choose	again.		Allow	the	user	to	clear	the	screen.	
* You	should	have	a	JavaFX	User	Interface.		You	can	use	any	control	that	youâ€™d	
like	for	the	choice	(examples:	radiobutton,	listview)	and	you	should	allow	
input	via	textview	and	output	via	label.		You	should	have	a	clear	button	that	
clears	all	data	(choices,	input	and	output).		
* You	should	use	recursion	to	convert	the String	data	to	the	appropriate	value.	
* You	should	have	a	separate	method	for	each	conversion	that	is	described	in	
your	book
